Your code is implementing Topological Sorting using DFS (Depth First Search) to find a valid course order. However, it does not detect cycles, which can lead to an incorrect result or infinite recursion in cases where a cycle exists in the course prerequisite graph.

ðŸ”´ Issues in Your Code
No Cycle Detection

Your DFS approach does not check for cycles. If there is a cycle in the graph, there is no valid ordering, and the function should return an empty array (new int[0]).
The current implementation may process cycles incorrectly and return an invalid order.
Stack is Used Incorrectly for Cycle Checking

Even if the stack size matches numCourses, it does not guarantee a valid ordering because a cycle might exist.


Fix: Use an Additional onPath Array to Detect Cycles
We can fix this by adding a onPath boolean array that tracks nodes in the current recursion stack.

What Changed?
Added onPath[] Array

onPath[i] = true; when visiting a node.
If we encounter a node that is already onPath[i] == true, a cycle exists â†’ return false.
onPath[i] = false; after recursion to remove it from the stack.
Cycle Handling

If a cycle is detected, we immediately return an empty array (new int[0]).
Stack Stores the Topological Order

The final order is built using post-order DFS, ensuring dependencies are resolved first.

Yes! BFS (Kahnâ€™s Algorithm for Topological Sorting) naturally handles cycles because it relies on in-degree tracking. If a cycle exists, some nodes will always have a nonzero in-degree, preventing them from being processed.

ðŸ”¹ Why Does BFS Handle Cycles?
We maintain an in-degree array (inDegree[i] = number of prerequisites for i).
We process nodes with zero in-degree first (courses with no prerequisites).
When we remove a node from the queue, we reduce the in-degree of its neighbors.
If a cycle exists, some nodes will never reach in-degree 0, preventing us from processing all courses.

 Time Complexity
Building the graph â†’ O(E), where E is the number of prerequisites.
Processing nodes in the queue â†’ O(V + E), where V is the number of courses.
Total Complexity â†’ O(V + E), which is optimal for topological sorting.
ðŸ”¹ How This Handles Cycles
Cycle-Free Case:

All numCourses nodes will be processed â†’ result.size() == numCourses.
Cycle Case:

If a cycle exists, some nodes will never reach inDegree == 0, and result.size() < numCourses.
We return new int[0] if we can't process all courses.

âœ… BFS (Kahnâ€™s Algorithm) is often preferred in practice because:

It naturally detects cycles.
It avoids recursion, making it more memory-efficient.
It works in O(V + E) time, the best possible for topological sorting.
